- The X-axis is backwards in an attempt to fool the viewer 
- It's an opinion poll, not actual crime rates
- Y-axis is exxagerated to make a trivial change seem big
- The margin of error is on the scale of the supposed change
- Equally spaced points on the X-axis don't correspond to equally spaced intervals
